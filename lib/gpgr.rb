#
#  gpgr is a very light interface to the command-line GPG (GNU 
#  Privacy Guard) tool which is soley concerned with making it
#  as easy as possible to encrypt files with one (or more) public
#  keys.
#
#  It does not provide any major key management tools and does not
#  support decryption.   
#
#  Usage:
#    
#    require 'rubygems'
#    require 'gpgr'
#
#    # Synopsis
#    #
#    list_of_keys = [ 'foo@example.com', 'bar@example.com' ]
#    Gpgr::Encrypt.file('/some_file.txt', :to => '/encrypted.gpg').encrypt_using(list_of_keys)
#
#    # To import all the public keys in a given directory
#    #
#    Gpgr::Keys.import_keys_at('/path/to/public/keys')
#   
#    #  Will encrypt for every single person you have a public key for
#    #
#    Gpgr::Encrypt.file('/some_file.txt', :to => '/encrypted.gpg').encrypt_using(Gpgr::Keys.installed_public_keys)
#
module Gpgr

  # Returns the command to execute to run GPG. It is defualted to /use/bin/env gpg 
  # which should correctly track down gpg on any UNIX-like operating system. If you
  # need to use this on Windows, simply change the method to return the path to where
  # gpg is installed.
  #
  # Of course, since grep is used in this script too, you'll need a windows version of
  # grep installed as well!
